# Bite-to-Byte

Bite to Byte is a video documentation project which explores the potentials of online culture  and platforms to share experiences, knowledge and concerns regarding food distribution across the globe. 

As an artistic project developed for Ok.Video web residency, it aims to expand the notions of video documentation, online exhibition and archiving in times of online video sharing platforms and social broadcasting softwares such as Youtube, Twitch and Hangout. 

## **Background**

It all began in the fall of 2015, when we started a Media Arts mobility master program together in Europe. There were 20 of us, from 18 different countries. Soon we discovered how much we could learn from each other just by sitting together, chatting and sharing a meal. The cultural contrasts sparked new interests and we bonded over our diversity while trying to adapt to new grounds. Dislocated from our natural environments, we started by sharing a kitchen and soon food become the bonding element. 

By sharing meals, we discovered a multitude of palates, but also discussed food waste, constraints in food supplies and systems, and reflected upon quality standards set by cultural and social boundaries. These discussions were then fed into our own artistic practices. 

As we began to go our separate ways, we sought to find alternative ways to continue this dialogue. The web then became our go to place, where we share our meals in front of a computer screen and develop collaborative projects. 

## **The proposal**

Out of this need to connect, Bite to Byte was then developed for the OK.Video web residency. As part of the festival’s theme Pangan, the project addresses current issues and initiatives related to food waste and distribution by exploring the concept of sharing. 

Food waste has become one of the major issues of our time, with big social, economical and environmental impacts. Many initiatives have risen over the past decade aiming to tackle these issues, from food banks to less institutional approaches, such as dumpster diving. Most, however, are grounded on the basic notions of sharing. 

Similarly, the web can be seen as a potentially open and diverse platform not only for content distribution, but also for the exchange of knowledge and experiences - from mundane everyday life events, such as posting a meal on Instagram, to data and information platforms which can enable and encourage individuals to rethink and propose alternative forms towards food distribution.

Within this framework, Bite to Byte invites artists and activists to share their experiences through the screens, creating an online dialogue between people from different backgrounds and encouraging them to discuss pressing issues from within their diverse scenarios. 

From sharing a meal via Google hangout to live video feed of ongoing activities, we artist and activist to address this global concern by exposing local differences and similitudes. Through an act of displacement, and motivated by the core principle of sharing, we encourage them to seek solutions and new perspectives on food systems. Moreover, by virtually dislocating them from their own environments, we invite them to inhabit the web and its platforms and share with the world the results of these encounters.
